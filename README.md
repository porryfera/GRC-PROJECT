# GRC POLICY DOCUNMENT

## Objective


As the Lead for the Governance, Risk, and Compliance (GRC) project at GIATAA, I was responsible for driving the strategic planning, implementation, and oversight of the organization's GRC framework. My role involved ensuring that GIATAA adhered to industry regulations, effectively managed risks, and maintained strong governance practices across all departments.

The main objective is to establish a structured and unified approach for managing:

Governance – Aligning business objectives with IT, security, and compliance strategies.

Risk Management – Identifying, assessing, mitigating, and monitoring risks that could affect the organization.

Compliance – Ensuring adherence to laws, regulations, standards, and internal policies.

More Specifically, We:
Define roles and responsibilities for governance, risk, and compliance processes.

Set expectations and boundaries for acceptable behavior, system usage, data protection, and reporting.

Provide a framework for risk assessment, mitigation strategies, and incident response.

Support audit readiness and regulatory compliance (e.g., ISO, NIST, etc.).

Create accountability at all levels, from executive leadership to individual contributors.

Promote a culture of security and compliance across the organization.
